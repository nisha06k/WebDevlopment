			CLASS AND OBJECTS
		</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>The classes are the most important feature of C++ that leads to Object Oriented programming. Class is a user defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating instance of that class. 
		</p>

		<p>The variables inside class definition are called as data members and the functions are called member functions.
		</p>

		<p><b>For example :</b> Class of birds, all birds can fly and they all have wings and  beaks. So here flying is a behavior and wings and beaks are part of their characteristics. And there are many different birds in this class with different names but they all posses this behavior and characteristics.</p>

		<p>Similarly, class is just a blue print, which declares and defines characteristics and behavior, namely data members and member functions respectively. And all objects of this class will share these characteristics and behavior.
		</p>
		<h2>More about Classes</h2>
		<ul style="list-style-image: url('sideimg.jpg'); text-align:  justify;">
			<li>
				Class name must start with an uppercase letter. If class name is made of more than one word, then first letter of each word must be in uppercase. <br><i>Example</i>,
				<pre>class Study, class Am_E_Learing etc</pre>
			</li>
			<li>
				Classes contain, data members and member functions, and the access of these data members and variable depends on the access specifiers.
			</li>
			<li>
				Class's member functions can be defined inside the class definition or outside the class definition.
			</li>
			<li>
				Class in C++ are similar to structures in C, the only difference being, class defaults to private access control, where as structure defaults to public.
			</li>
			<li>
				All the features of OOPS, revolve around classes in C++. Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction etc.
			</li>
			<li>
				Objects of class holds separate copies of data members. We can create as many objects of a class as we need.
			</li>
			<li>
				Classes do posses more characteristics, like we can create abstract classes, immutable classes, all this we will study later. 
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Objects</h2>
		<p>
			Class is mere a blueprint or a template. No storage is assigned when we define a class. Objects are instances of class, which holds the data variables declared in class and the member functions work on these class objects. 
		</p>
		<p>
			And whenever the object is out of its scope, another special class member function called <b>Destructor</b> is called, to release the memory reserved by the object. C++ doesn't have Automatic Garbage Collector like in JAVA, in C++ Destructor performs this task.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each object has different data variables. Objects are initialised using special class functions called <b>Constructors</b>. We will study about constructors later.
