			HISTORY AND FEATURES OF 'C++'
		</h1>
		<hr>
		<h2>History</h2>
		<p style="text-align:  justify;">
			      C++ programming language was developed at Bell laboratories in early 1980's by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension to C language. The name C++ was coined by Rick Mascitti where "++" is the increment operator. C++ is a statically typed, free form, multiparadigm, compiled general purpose language. C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX.C++ is a combination of C and Simula 67 language. His language included classes, basic inheritance, inlining, default function arguments, and strong type checking in addition to all the features of the C language.

		<h2>Features</h2>
		<p style="text-align:  justify;">
			Following are the features of C++
		</p>
		<ul style="list-style-image: url('sideimg.jpg'); text-align:  justify;">
			
			<li><b><i>DATA ABSTRACTION:</i></b><br>
			 	Abstraction refers to the act of representing essential features without including the background details or explanations.  We don't need to know how a computer is working inside in order to use it, this is data abstraction.
			 </li>
			<li><b><i>ENCAPSULATION:</i></b><br>
				 The wrapping up of data and operations/functions into a single unit is known as Encapsulation.It is somewhat complementary to abstraction. <br><i>For Example:-</i> Everyone knows about the mobile applications but not the method of its manufacturing.
			</li>
			<li><b><i>MODULARITY:</i></b><br>
				  It is the property of a system that has been decomposed into a set of cohesive and loosely coupled. It reduces the complexity to some degree and creates a number of well-defined boundaries within the program.<br><i>For Example:-</i> for larger applications in the program may be divided into modules to reduce complication.
			 </li>
			 <li><b><i>INHERITANCE:</i></b><br>
				 It is the capability of one class of things to inherit capabilities or properties from another class. 
			 </li>
			 <li><b><i>POLYMORPHISM: </i></b><br>
				 It is the ability for a message or data to be processed in more than one form.
			 </li>
