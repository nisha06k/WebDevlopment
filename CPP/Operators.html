			OPERATORS

		<hr>
		<p>
			The operations being carried out on data are represented by operators. The operations are represented by operators and objects of the operations are referred to as operands.	
		</p>
		<h2>Types Of Operator</h2>
		<h3>Arithmetic Operators</h3>

			<tr>
				<td>1</td>
				<td>==</td>

				<td>(A == B) is not true</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2</td>
				<td>!=</td>
				<td>Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.</td>

				<td>3</td>
				<td> &lt; </td>

				<td>(A &lt;= B) is not true</td>

				<td>(A &gt;= B) is true</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<h3>Logical Operators</h3>
		<table id="tab1">
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th width="50px">S.No</th>
					<th width="70px">Operator</th>
					<th width="300px" >Description</th>
					<th width="230" >Example (A=1 and B=0)</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tr>
				<td>1</td>
				<td>&&</td>
				<td>Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non-zero, then condition becomes true.</td>
				<td>(A && B) is not true</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2</td>
				<td>||</td>
				<td>Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands is non-zero, then condition becomes true.</td>
				<td>(A || B) is true</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>3</td>
				<td> ! </td>
				<td>Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then Logical NOT operator will make false.</td>
				<td>(A ! B) is true</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<h3>Bitwise Operators</h3>
		<table id="tab1">
			<thead>
				<tr>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2</td>
				<td>+=</td>

				<td>C += A is equivalent to C = C + A</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>3</td>
				<td>-= </td>
				<td>Subtract AND assignment operator, It subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to left operand</td>
				<td>C -= A is equivalent to C = C - A</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>4</td>
				<td> *= </td>
				<td>Multiply AND assignment operator, It multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to left operand</td>
				<td>C *= A is equivalent to C = C * A</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>5</td>
				<td>/=</td>
				<td>Divide AND assignment operator, It divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand</td>
				<td>C /= A is equivalent to C = C / A</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>6</td>
				<td>%=</td>
				<td>Modulus AND assignment operator, It takes modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand</td>
				<td>C %= A is equivalent to C = C % A</td>
