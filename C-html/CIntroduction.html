			INTRODUCTION OF 'C'
		</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
			C is most widely used general-purpose, procedural and imperative computer programming language in operating systems and embedded system development, which was originally developed by <b>Dennis M. Ritchie</b> in 1972 at the Bell Telephone Laboratories.  
		</p>
		<p>
			The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX applications programs have been written in C. The C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons.

		<h2>History of C</h2>
		<ul style="list-style-image: url('sideimg.jpg');">
			<li>C language features were derived from earlier language called "B" (Basic Combined Programming Language - BCPL).</li>
			<li>C language was invented for implementing UNIX operating system.</li>
			<li>In 1978, Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan published the first edition  "The C Programming Language" and commonly known as K&R C.</li>
			<li>In 1983, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) established a committee to provide a modern, comprehensive definition of C. The resulting definition, the ANSI standard, or "ANSI C", was completed late 1988.</li>
